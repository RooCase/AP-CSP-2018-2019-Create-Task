This is the exported copy of a webapp I wrote within code.org's framework for the 2018-19 school year's AP Computer Science Principles exam. 
It's a time management tracker, designed for people who are self-employed to track multiple jobs, how long they've worked, etc. 
It's currently in its most "complete" form, though it is missing some features I would have liked to implement when I first created it.

If you want to work on it, have at. It's mainly written in a modified version of JS. I'm sure the code will need some tweaking to work on anything that isn't code.org's servers.

Please excuse the angsty comments about how bad my code is. I was 16 and certain that every piece of code I touched was absolute garbage and complaining about it would make it better.
